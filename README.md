Butter
===
Butter is a framework for OS X that seeks to provide a set of commonly used controls which are full replacements for their cell-based AppKit counterparts. Butter is written on top of [Rebel](https://github.com/github/Rebel). This framework is far from complete, and ***is not ready for general use***. 

This framework seeks to provide the following:

- Image-based customization of controls
- Complete independence of cell-based controls
- A complete, unified, and minimalistic default style for controls

The following controls will be provided. All controls are assumed to be layer-backed by default unless otherwise specified.

- `BTRButton` – an image-based button with block APIs
- `BTRImageView`
- `BTRTextField`
- `BTRLabel` – non-bordered text field
- `BTRSlider`
- `BTRSegmentedControl`
- `BTRProgressIndicator`
- `BTRCheckbox`
- `BTRSwitch`
- `BTRRefreshControl` – a stylish pull-to-refresh control for scroll views

More controls will be added in due time if seen fit.

`BTRCollectionView` can be found on its [own repo.](https://github.com/ButterKit/BTRCollectionView)
